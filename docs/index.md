# Summer 2020 reflection
When we first began planning our remote research, I had doubts that it would be effective. However, after discussing our approach during the first week of work, we began our editing and I was very pleasantly surprised at how smoothly the process went. By using Zoom and Atom teletype, we were able to discuss and edit the manuscript just as efficiently, and in some cases more, as we ordinarily would in the lab. While I have been in MID for several years at this point, working with a partner and having to explain the actual process of editing a Homeric text forced me to actually retain information I was usually able to obtain from another member. I believe the most important takeaway of this research was learning how to adapt to a new format given unforeseen circumstances. Needing to modify our original project and conduct research with a new team taught me to be resourceful and look for new opportunities in a difficult situation, a skill that will surely help me in my studies, future career, and life in general.
